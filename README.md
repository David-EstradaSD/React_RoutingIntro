# React_RoutingIntro

### Overview
This is a dummy app I created as part of an introductory lesson into React Routing. Specifically, this lesson taught how to build a multi-page "_single page application_" as to adhere to the React design of staying on the same web page without having to leave the browser and send more Http requests.

### Technologies
* React, JavaScript
* ReactRouter libraries 
* _Switch, BrowserRouter, Route, NavLink and Link_ components
* _useParams_ custom hook 
* _path, exact, to_ built-in props


### How to Run
This app is currently only ran locally. Just do the usual steps:
* git clone the repo
* npm start 

### Lessons Learned
This dummy app taught me about setting up a project with multi-page domains / path URLs while still maintaining that React effect of "_Single Page Application_". This project was built with the assistance of a tutorial through Udemy that taught the _React framework_ ( 48+ hours ).
