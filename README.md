# React_RoutingIntro

### Overview
This is a dummy app I created as part of an introductory lesson into React Routing. Specifically, this lesson taught how to build a multi-page "_single page application_" as to adhere to the React design of staying on the same web page without having to leave the browser and send more Http requests.

### Technologies (TODO: ... // 


* React, Redux, JavaScript
* HttpRequests / Asynchronous Functions with Redux
* Side Effects (_useEffect_)
* Data Store (_Actions, Payloads, Reducers_)
* Redux Toolkit
* [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) 
* Custom React Hooks (_useSelector, useDispatch_)
* Re-usable components

### How to Run
This app is currently only ran locally. Just do the usual steps:
* git clone the repo
* npm start 

### Lessons Learned
This dummy app taught me... TODO: //


This project was built with the assistance of a tutorial through Udemy that taught the _React framework_ ( 48+ hours ).
